      My name is David Clarke, welcome to my professional portfolio. I am originally from the Bay Area and am currently living in Brooklyn, NY. In my free time I like to lift weights, play basketball, play guitar, and hang out with friends around the city.

      <p>I've created this portfolio to showcase some of the recent work I've done as a full stack web development student at the University of Pennsylvania. Feel free to browse the page, you can contact me using the links at the bottom. Enjoy!</p>
